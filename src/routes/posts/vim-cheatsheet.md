## Foreword

Neovim is my favorite editor in ZSH. However, in a desktop environment I mostly write code in a Jetbrains IDE with IdeaVim plugin. Plus, some operations can be achieved in multiple ways, only one of which is preferred. Therefore, not all Vim keys are relevant to me. On top of that, it's not necessary to document basic keys like `hjkl` so they won't be included, either. For the full Vim cheatsheet, refer to [here](https://devhints.io/vim).
